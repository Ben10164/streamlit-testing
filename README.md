# Testing

This is a repo that is for me to share with my friends some cool stuff im learning about over winter break during my senior year.

There is a dockerfile/makefile that you can use to run streamlit, or you can just do `streamlit run Home.py`. Up to you.

The code for the pages are in the `pages/` directory.
